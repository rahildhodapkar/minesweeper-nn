# Minesweeper NN

## Description
This project utilizes CNN and RNN neural networks to learn how to play the game Minesweeper. 
Currently, the CNN architecture can win around 30% of games when played on "easy mode." 
Future plans include properly utilizing attention to gain a better win-rate, especially on harder
difficulties.

## To Use
Make sure you have PyTorch and Numpy if you want to experiment with the notebook. I suggest using Google Colab
to quickly test the notebook.

## Technologies Used
Python, PyTorch, Jupyter Notebooks
